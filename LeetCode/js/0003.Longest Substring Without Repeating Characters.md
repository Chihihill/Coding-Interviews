# 0003. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Question
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** `"abcabcbb"`
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:** The answer is `"abc"`, with the length of `3`. 

**Example 2:**
**Input:**  `"bbbbb"`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:** The answer is `"b"`, with the length of `1`.

**Example 3:**
**Input:**  `"pwwkew"`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:** The answer is `"wke"`, with the length of `3`. 


**Note:**
Note that the answer must be a substring, `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Solution
```javascript
undefined == false // false

s = '123';
s[4] //undefined -- s[4] is undefined
!s[4] //true -- Is s[4] undefined? Yes, it is undefined.
s[3] !== undefined // true -- s[3] is defined
```

1. First, we need to defined a start point.
2. Creat a empty dictionary. If the character is not in the character, we put the character in the dictionary and mark its val as i.
3. Calculating the maxLength as current index minus the start point. IF the length is larger than the previous maxLength, then update it.
4. If the character has already in the dictionary, first, we need to change the start point to the previous same one. And then, we update the value of it in the dictionary to the current i.

NOTE that like `string 'tmmzuxt'`, we might meet the situation that the character `t` has appeared in previous, but we are start counting at `m`. In this case, we **DO NOT** change the start point to the previous character `t`.
So, we need to make sure thst the index of character we are counting is larger than the start point.


## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    //1. maxLength = i - startpoint
    //2. s[i] is repeated or not
    //undefined == false /false
    var maxLength = 0;
    var startPoint = -1;
    var d = [];
    for(var i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
        if(d[s[i]] !== undefined && d[s[i]] > startPoint){
            startPoint = d[s[i]];
            d[s[i]] = i;
        } else{
            d[s[i]] = i;
            if(i - startPoint > maxLength){
                maxLength = i - startPoint; 
            }
        } 
    }
    return maxLength;
};
```
