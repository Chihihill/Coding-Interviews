# 0108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

## Question
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

**Example :**
Given the sorted array:` [-10,-3,0,5,9]`,

One possible answer is: `[0,-3,9,-10,null,5]`, which represents the following height balanced BST:

        0
       / \
     -3   9
     /   /
    -10  5

## Solution
1. BST is a tree that the value of every left child node will never bigger than its parent node, and the value of every right child node will never smaller than its parent node;
2. With the given sorted array, we can can easy to find the root of the tree, which is the index `nums.length/2`;
3. Next, we can use recursion to find `root.left` and `root.right`;
4. But we need to notice that if there is no right child node, we need to set the node as unll; So when is the situation that there has no node? It is the time that the nums.length equal to zero.


## Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var sortedArrayToBST = function(nums) {
    if(!nums.length) return null;
    var mid = Math.floor(nums.length/2);
    var root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
    
    root.left = sortedArrayToBST(nums.slice(0,mid));
    root.right = sortedArrayToBST(nums.slice(mid+1));
    return root;
};
```
