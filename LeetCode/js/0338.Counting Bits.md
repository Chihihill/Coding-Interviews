# 0338. Counting Bits

## Question
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** 2
**Output:** [0,1,1]

**Example 2:**
**Input:** 5
**Output:** [0,1,1,2,1,2]

**Follow up:**
It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

[DP Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/discuss/79557/How-we-handle-this-question-on-interview-Thinking-process-%2B-DP-solution)

## Code
**n&1 == 1**
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var countBits = function(num) {
    var allnum = [];
    var count1 = 0;
    var countBit = 0;
    var res = [];
    while(count1 <= num){
        allnum.push(count1);
        count1++;
    }
    for(var i=0; i<allnum.length; i++){
        for(var j=0; j<32; j++){
            if((allnum[i]&1) == 1){
                countBit++;
            }
            allnum[i] = allnum[i] >> 1;
        }
        res.push(countBit);
        countBit = 0;
    }
    return res;
};
```
