# 0739. Daily Temperatures

## Question
Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

## Solution
`Array.from()` 方法从一个类似数组或可迭代对象创建一个新的，浅拷贝的数组实例。
1. First, we need to build a output array which have the same length with the input list T. And set each items'value to 0;
2. Write a for loop to traverse the input list T; when the ith item's value is larger which means the weather is warmer than previous, `T[i] > T[stack[stack.length-1]]`, calculate `res[j] = i - j`. `j` is representing today.
3. Note that what we push to the stack is `i` not temperatures.

## Code
**Reducing stack**
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} T
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var dailyTemperatures = function(T) {
    //T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
    //set an array which have the same length property with input list T, and set all items to zero
    var res = Array.from({length:T.length}, x=>x=0);
    //stack's index j
    var stack = [];
    for(var i=0; i<T.length; i++){
        //if / while
        //we use while because when there are not only one item in the stack, we need to compare every item with the new item
        while(stack.length>0 && T[stack[stack.length-1]] < T[i]){
            var j = stack.pop();
            res[j] = i - j; 
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }
    return res;
};
```
