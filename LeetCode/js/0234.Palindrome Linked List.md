# 0234. Palindrome Linked List

## Question
Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.
**NOTE :** A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward

**Example 1:**
**Input:** `1->2`
**Output:** `false`

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `1->2->2->1`
**Output:** ` true`

## Solution
**TWO pointers**
1. Using the fast pointer which takes two steps every round to count whether we have already reach the end of the list or not;
2. Using stack and the slow pointer which takes one step every round to record the value of the node it pass; the length of the record should be the half of the list;
3. When we stop, we can notice that the slow pointer is stopping at the end of the half of the list, and what we need to compare is the beginning of the next half of the list; => `slow = slow.next`
4. Comparing the rest half of the list with the stack;


## Code
**Method 1: TWO pointers**
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPalindrome = function(head) {
    // using two pointers to record the half of linkedlist
    // the fast pointer is used to count
    var fast = head;
    var slow = head;
    var stack = [];
    while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
        stack.push(slow.val);
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    // compare the rest of linked list with the stack
    if(fast != null){
        slow = slow.next;
    }
    while(slow != null){
        var top = stack.pop();
        if(slow.val != top){
            return false;
        }
        slow = slow.next;
    }
    return true;
};
```

**Method 2: Reverse the half of the linked list**
```javascript

```
