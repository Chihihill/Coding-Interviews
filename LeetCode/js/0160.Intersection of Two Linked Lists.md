## Solution
    A go through A+B steps will get to the intersected node
    at the same, B go through B+A steps will get to the intersected node
    if there is no intersection, the condition to quit the while loop is p1=null=p2

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} headA
 * @param {ListNode} headB
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var getIntersectionNode = function(headA, headB) {
//     A go through A+B steps will get to the intersected node
//     at the same, B go through B+A steps will get to the intersected node
//     if there is no intersection, the condition to quit the while loop is p1=null=p2
    var p1 = headA;
    var p2 = headB;
    while(p1 != p2){
        if(p1 == null){
            p1 = headB;
        }else {
            p1 = p1.next;
        }
        
        if(p2 == null){
            p2 = headA;
        }else {
            p2 = p2.next;
        }
    }
    return p1;
};
