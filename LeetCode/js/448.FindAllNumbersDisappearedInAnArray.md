# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

## Question
Given an array of integers where 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**

**Input:**
`[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`

**Output:**
`[5,6]`

## Solution

 From the information we can know that there are n numbers in the array. It means that if the array is sorted, the value of the interger can show its index.

 We just need to find which index cannot correspond to an interger of the array.


1. Determine whether the array is null or not.
2. Turn the value in the index which equals to the number of the array to negative.
3. Find the positive value and return their index plus one.



## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findDisappearedNumbers = function(nums) {
    if(nums == null){
        return false;
    }
    var res = [];
    nums.forEach((val, ind, arr)=>{
        var temp = Math.abs(nums[ind]) - 1;
        if(nums[temp] > 0){
            nums[temp] *= -1;
        }
    })
    nums.forEach((val, ind, arr)=>{
        if(val > 0){
            res.push(ind + 1)
        }
    })
    return res;
};
```
